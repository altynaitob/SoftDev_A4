# SoftDev_A4

## To do: 

1. Create a .py file containing:
   - a script docstring (i.e. docstring at the top of the document)
      module/script docstrings: https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/#script-docstrings
   - 3+ (geospecific) functions, importing the necessary libraries in the script
   - docstrings for each function + comments throughout if more complex
      General docstring convention: https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/
2. Import and use the functions in a notebook, and explain with markdown cells
3. Commit the notebook to your own repo along with the necessary conda environment file

## Workflow
I created a conda environment containing folium, pandas and openrouteservices packages.
Use geospecific functions. 
Script docstring.
